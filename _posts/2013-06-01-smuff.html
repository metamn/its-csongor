  <p>
    The collaboration with Smuff starte in the founding phase. The business idea for an online gadget store was ready and Smuff needed someone to build a web product around.
  </p>

  <p>
    During years and iterations we have managed to build a custom e-commerce solution with a high conversion rate design, and, an automatic content distribution platform for sales and marketing, measurable and optimizable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today Smuff is market leader with 44% of returning customers.

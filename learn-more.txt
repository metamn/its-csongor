Looking for an one-stop shop for your next website?

You are in the right place.

In the last couple of years I’ve helped startups and organizations to get the most out of their web presence

I’m a multi-disciplinary web specialist with software development, project management, business development and startup founding experience. I’ve been on both sides of the table and now merging all my experiences into this venture.

Usually I’m commissioned to redesign web pages, sites or applications after a certain level of maturity. All my customers are well educated in web trends and technologies and they want a shift to the latest standards.

They choose me because I’m like a mini in-house web team: from identity design, responsive web design, front- and back-end development, deployment and hosting, search engine optimization, integrations with social networks and ecosystems to e-commerce I can help them to lay out a stable foundation for their business.

How I do all these and still fit the budget? 

The secret is I’m working directly in the browser skipping all third parties like Photoshop and Illustrator. Instead I’m using a custom web framework developed through years.

With carefully crafted re-usable web components my task reduces to design your interface in such way to make visitors follow your business goals.

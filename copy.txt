I'm a User Experience designer creating responsive websites.

Coming from software development I'm specialized in front-end, content management and storytelling technologies. 



I'm a native web designer working in the browser skipping Photoshop, Illustrator and reducing project time by half.

I design  websites which deliver the message and drive visitors to engagement -- essential to make your product or business successful.

I also create the front-end code for your website and integrate with your backend, social networks or other ecosystems



I've studied Mathematics and Computer Science.

My career started with software development in international environment across many positions, companies and countries.

As side projects I've started to design and develop websites for my friends and with the introduction of the iPhone and Responsive design the need for unicorns became obvious and shifted me to UI/UX design and responsive front-end development.

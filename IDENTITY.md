# Identity

- this is the last phase of the project

- the major goal is to give an uniform look to everything

- the foundations of the site were prepared at the previous phases: content, layout, typography, colors, navigation

- now everything is wrapped up into a whole

- some key landmarks were identified at  the previous phases, now we will build upon these


## Landmarks

1. Big, asymmetric images / mockups

2. Smooth and simple, minimal typography

3. Smooth gradient backgrounds


## Styleguide

- up until now the only necessary styleguide entries were added

- now we should complete and refactor the Styleguide and the project folder structure


## What's missing and what to fix

1. Some content like figcaptions, additional explanations / project feature descriptions. The mockups and copy must be in flow, they must be a complete story

2. Some images are too large, like mobile and tablet screenshots driven by the fact the iorad mockups were looking bad in small sizes so all other mockups were enlarged too to keep consistency

3. Padding 

4. Services and technologies transformed into good looking sentences

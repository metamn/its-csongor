  <p>
    The collaboration with Smuff started in the founding phase. The business idea for an online gadget store was ready and Smuff needed someone to build a web product around.
  </p>

  <p>
    During years and iterations we have managed to build a custom e-commerce solution with a high conversion rate design and an automatic content distribution platform&mdash;measurable and optimizable&mdash;to aid sales and marketing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today Smuff is local market leader with 44% of returning customers.

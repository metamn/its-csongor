  <p>
    Organized Crime And Corruption Reporting Project had it's website dated from the last decade. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We've managed to come up with a modern, newspaper-like redesign with clean headlines, good structure, clean understanding of priorities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new site supports all screens from mobile devices up to large projectors.

  <p>
    Scatter had ready a web application to connect local businesses with customers. They needed a website before the launch.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've created a couple of landing pages describing product features both for businesses and customers. And a Pricing page to let people subscribe to services.
  </p>
  <p>
    On design the requirements were big typography with big background images, and intuitive HTML / CSS graphics to explain product features. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On development side we had to make everything fully responsible.

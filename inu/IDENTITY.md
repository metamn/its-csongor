# Identity

- this is the last phase of the project

- the major goal is to give an uniform look to everything

- the foundations of the site were prepared at the previous phases: content, layout, typography, colors, navigation

- now everything is wrapped up into a whole

- some key landmarks were identified at  the previous phases, now we will build upon these


## Landmarks

1. Big, asymmetric images / mockups

2. Smooth and simple, minimal typography

3. Smooth gradient backgrounds


## What's missing and what to fix
 
1. Some content like figcaptions, additional explanations / project feature descriptions. The mockups and copy must be in flow, they must be a complete story

2. Some images are too large, like mobile and tablet screenshots driven by the fact the iorad mockups were looking bad in small sizes so all other mockups were enlarged too to keep consistency

3. Padding 

4. Services and technologies transformed into good looking sentences


## Finally

- The frontpage and portfolio thumb navigation were finalized at this phase, together with link design

- From landmarks the #1 (mockups) and #2 (smooth typography) were kept. The #3 (gradients) is applied to portfolio items only (header, body, navigation, footer). On frontpage such a gradient would cut the power. So the About section is moved to black and white

- Still the common aura of the whole website has to be found at the next phase. Currently we have:

1. On Portfolio items a better balance has to be found between power (mockups) and grace (smooth typography, gradients and navigation). Maybe larger fonts and top/bottom borders could give more strength to the page moving the site towards powerfullness

2. The frontpage is a little bit raw; maybe looking unfinished. The top section can be transformed to more finesse by lowering font sizes and changing the background image. The About section can be enhanced by an avatar and contact icons, maybe a background pattern.

3. Probably the final result will look powerful; On portfolio grace will be replaced by power with big typography, and, on frontpage the rawness will be re-sized/decorated up to powerfullness.


## Next

- All these goals above can be accomplished by a proper Styleguide, where strict and harmonic rules are defined and applied through all the site.

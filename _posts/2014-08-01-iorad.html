  <p>
    iorad is a startup in the beta launch phase going live at the first time in the next weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior launching they've decided to give a face lift for their two most important pages: the Pricing and the Checkout.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project requirements were: speed of execution, keeping current visual assets, cross-device and browser compatibility. And a week duration from signing contract and final delivery.
